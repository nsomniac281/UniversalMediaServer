   Often in order to help diagnose and fix your issue we need your "debug information". We have made it very easy to save and attach it to made the issue:

    Start UMS
    Go to the Logs tab
    Press the "Create TRACE logs" button which restarts UMS in the TRACE mode. If that doesn't work for some reason, either select "Trace" from the "Log Level" dropdown at the bottom or set "log_level = TRACE" in the configuration file and restart UMS manually.
    Reproduce the bug
    Click "Pack debug files" on the lower left
    Click "Zip selected files"
    Save the zip file to a location you will remember
    Create the new issue. Describe your problem and attach the zip file
    
    Thanks for your patricipation
